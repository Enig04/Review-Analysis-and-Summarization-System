"Well you get more than what you pay for.At this price you won't find a customizable rgb keyboard you'll mostly find the Rainbow mode led keyboard.I had my doubts about Cosmic Byte before when I bought the supernova mouse few months backAnd I wasn't disappointed at all.Like literally these guys are making quality and necessary products at a reasonable price.Now enough praising.Lets get to the specs.Yes it is not a fully rgb keyboard but you get 7 backlight colors to choose from.And per key customizable is also available.There are 13 effects you can cycle through by pressing FN+ scroll lock.4 brightness levels can be controlled by pressing FN+ DOWN & UP arrow keys.FN+ LEFT & RIGHT arrow keys are for effect speed control.FN+ HOME is for changing colors for the effects.There are 8 preset game lighting modes just press FN+ any 1-8 number at the top to cycle.FN+ END, FN+DEL & FN+ INS are for 3 customizable profile recording.In this mode you can customize each key with your desirable Color. Just hit the button again to save the profile.Everything is Controlled via Keyboard no software which is a plus a point for me.Detachable wrist rest comes in handy for typing as well as for gaming too.There are 4 multimedia keys above the numpad at the right.Volume upVolume downMuteAnd a shortcut for calculator.The cable is thick and braided always nice to see at this price point.A full size numpad at this price point.2 rubberized flip up feet for some elevation.Over all its a solid buy.But few minor cons.1. Glossy wrist rest... Yeah finger print magnet.2. Not very dust proof either.3. The color or the wrist rest should have some options the red color doesn't match with my setup.4. Some of the alternate key legends should be transparent for LED's to shrine through it.5. Macro option via Keyboard like for the leds.6. No User Manuel, I had to figure out by my own every mode etc etc.7. Finally the key switches. The keys are Chinese clones of cherry mx. The brand is unknown thats my fear lies because except Kalih, Outemu and Gaeteron most of these switches have received poor reviews over the time about being not accurate, ghosting issues, switch or the LED failing/dying in few months of use.But don't worry from where I'm seeing it.. I'm loving every inch of this keyboard. Oh yes these are Only available in Mx Blue format.So who are looking for a silent keyboard you might have to look somewhere else.Like I said at the start.Worth it.If you're new to this whole peripheral thing and want to upgrade from your normal membrane keyboard this it for you.Or if you're looking for a cheap mechanical keyboard with no nonsense features and decent aesthetics and ergonomics you'll like it for sure.If you have money go for corsair razer etc.On a budget? Buy this in an instant.Will update in future.*Edit*Its February and it works like ‚ù§, on the other side... Its a dust magent üòÇ but its fine just keep cleaning it regularly and you're good to go.",5,positive
"""Well made"" with ""3 custom profiles"" with ""per-key lighting"" (7 colors to choose from) - This is something you must know. This feature Not very well advertised but you really can record 3 custom profiles on the keyboard itself with per key lighting as per your preference. Light up any key you want with whatever (7) color you want and keep rest off. These settings stay saved every after reboot in keyboard memory which is awesome.""Dedicated volume up/down/mute keys"" are present too - which sets this keyboard apart from similar keyboards from other manufacturers. A extremely important requirement for me. Good job Cosmic Byte for including them.Included manual tells how to set lights and modes. One of the reviewers said manual not there. But manual was there in my box. Lights are bright with different brightness levels. Can set single or multi light modes. I really love the single ""WHITE"" leds. Multi color is fun but White is elegant.1 star less as I did not like the click-click and lack of software support - I am coming from cherry mx red and I found the cherry mx reds in my roccat ryos much lighter to touch and they were quiet. I want cosmic byte to offer a variant with BROWN/RED switches and I will definitely buy that. The leds on my roccat ryos died within 4 months which was a real shame and i really need leds for night play. I hope cosmic byte leds have longer life... time will tell.If you do not mind the loud clicky noise and feel of blue switches, this keyboard if a must buy for you!!! I admire cosmic byte to offer this keyboard at this price. Great Job!!!Blue switches feel very different from membrane or cherry mx red. I am a touch typist and blue switches give me finger fatigue after typing for long (probably because i am used to the mx red for so long).Feedback for next version - Include at least basic software support to customize keys (at least the function keys). I know this will make the price go up but I as programmer consider the feature worth the cost.",4,positive
"I like it very much, it's cheap and best keyboard I ever have...go for it if you need budget gaming keyboard...it's really nice keyboard... AND after 6 months this keyboard`s light won`t work well, THESE KEYS (ASDFGHJKL;'][, AND CAPS LK) all keys light not response well, sometimes they are not changing colours sometimes they are. evert key is working but accept light not good enough. So i contacted to cosmic byte online and they told me we arrange a pickup order from your address and they do it well. then they told me that your new keyboard will be send to your address. and finally i got new one . thanks for cosmic byte and amazon.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",5,positive
"Got the brown switch version at 3k.It's a steal.Pros- price- Good RGB (I usually keep it turned off)- the design is very classy. No kiddish extra cheap branding and all.- its still makes some noise, and I feel the fun of typing.- cable is braided (quality stuff)Cons- the keys might be too soft for some people.- selected keys like backspace, shifts, etc make a little different noise. Might be on purpose, or might be loose.- Love the handrest.Mann ki Baat- I am writing this review coz am loving typing on this.- Don't through away the manual as the backlight key combinations are written there, and it's hard to find it online.- excise duty proper hoti to foreign se yahi price pe bluetooth wala mangwata.
